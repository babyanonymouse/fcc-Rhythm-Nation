## Layout & Slot

- code inside the layout tags is considered the slot of the layout. The slot is where the content of the page will be rendered.

## Styling

- adding `is:global` attribute in the style tag will apply styles globally. It is used to apply styles to the entire application.
- styles without the attribute will apply to the component only.
  **Tailwind**
  add tailwind using this command
  ```bash
        npx astro add tailwind
  ```
